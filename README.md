## Chromeless

**Chromeless** is a Chrome web browser without the chrome.

Kinda like [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com), but faster to configure. Just install the extension and every time you launch it you'll get a new window.

### Local Installation
`git clone` this repo. Go to Chrome Settings > Extensions ([chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)). Choose "Load unpacked extension" and choose the `unpacked-extension` folder in this repo.

### On the Chrome Web Store?

I'll put this on the Chrome Web Store as soon as Google makes that available. See [Chrome Packaged App Publishing](http://developer.chrome.com/stable/apps/publish_app.html) for more information.
